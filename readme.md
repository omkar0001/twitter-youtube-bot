True AI makes customer service semi-automatic with cutting-edge artificial intelligence technology. The solution is an augmentation of the customer service agentâ€™s workflow. With True AI, the agent automatically receives suggested answers to all incoming queries in real-time. The suggested answers are generated by an AI after it has analyzed all historical tickets and chat-interactions in your organization.

**NOTE: This app is currently tested in a closed beta. Only companies in the beta program will be able to use it to get suggestions. In the coming weeks, the app will be made available to any company.**

How it works
- When a ticket or chat-message comes in they are sent to the AI
- The AI analyzes the conversation and proposes three suggestions
- The agent can choose any of these three suggestions by clicking on them

Requirements to be able to use it
- There should be a history of at least 5,000 solved tickets or chat-conversation (the AI needs much data to learn how to respond)
- The AI works best on repetitive messages, therefore some of the incoming messages should be repetitive
